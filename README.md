# rock-paper-scissors
This project utilizes the Nearby Connections API provided by Google Play, allowing users to communicate with other users within close proximity (within 100 meters) even without an internet connection. 
Using this API, this workshop has created a project where users can search for nearby users, establish connections, and play a game of rock-paper-scissors together. 
Throughout the implementation of the project, we will also gradually learn about the communication principles of the Nearby Connections API.
